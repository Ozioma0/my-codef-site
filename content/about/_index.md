This will not be your average travel blog! We are both student/ extremely budget friendly but i also have tips and tricks to elevate those holidays for us!

# *__About me__*
I am currently a student at the University of Leeds who uses travelling as an escape from all life's stressors. Before the age of 25 i would like to have visisted at least one country on every continent (except Antartica). I mainly travel with friends or family and now i'm travelling with everyone who reads this blog. So welcome aboard!

# __Why i started travelling__

Well, honestly there is no big story here. I started travelling because my parents travelled a lot and my family went on vacation often. But i kept travelling because i absolutely love it.
